# Stubhub Price Model
## Goal: In my past life, I sold concert tickets on Stubhub. The goal of this project is to model the data of ticket prices for sold-out general admission concerts. The data with map the price of the lowest ticekt in relation to number of days until the event as well as the number of tickets still available.
### Technology: use Node with ExpressJS to fetch concernt price data from the Stubhub API. The data is then stored to a persistant MongoDB database. Eventually this backend will be hooked up to a React frontend.
